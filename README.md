## Abstract
LaTeX has been widely used to write research papers. Unlike most popular articles which have introduced various LaTeX syntax and tricks to achieve the desired effects and formats in the compiled _output_, in this document I will suggest some tips about how to write and organize these _input_ LaTeX source files. While having little impact on the final result, these tips may be helpful to maintain the LaTeX source and thus facilitate research collaborations. This document is based on my personal experience of writing papers in the field of computer graphics and thus may not apply to other fields.

## Compilation
Compile either _final.tex_ or _draft.tex_ using PDFLaTeX to get the version without or with notes.
